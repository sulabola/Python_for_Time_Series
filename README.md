# Python for Time Series Data Analysis

Time series analysis plays a vital role in forecasting and decision-making across finance, economics, and engineering. This repository introduces fundamental tools and coding practices for time series data analysis using Python. It is based on the Udemy course *“Python for Time Series Data Analysis”* by **Jose Portilla**, Head of Data Science at Pierian Training.  

These notes have been extended to include explanations. The repository will continue to evolve as more advanced chapters covering statistical and machine learning models.

### HTML Files

The `HTML Files` folder contains the **rendered Jupyter notebooks** for each chapter.  
These HTML files show both the **Python code and output (plots, tables, results)** without requiring a Jupyter environment.  
To view them:
1. Download the desired `.html` file from the folder.  
2. Open it locally in any modern web browser.  

This allows users to review the full notebook, including code, explanations, and figures, even without running Python.
